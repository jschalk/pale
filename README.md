PALE Version 0.0.0

`pale` is a python library for listening to the climate of a community.

## 0.0 About pale

'pale' is a tool that helps me listen to the people important to me in my life.  I hope it can help you too. Let's assume I want to listen to you. If you give me a list of things that are important to you I want to be able to take your list, combine it with the lists of all the others I am about and get a output of a list of things I should do and metrics that describe my ability to do things . pale does this for all   

'pale' is based on the philosohpy of Emmanuel Levinas (1906-1995) as expressed in his book "Totality and Infinity: An Essay on Exteriority" (translated by Lingis, 1969) and taught to me by Jules Simon PhD (born 1959) Professor at The University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP). I took Jules's course "Levinas: Phenomenology of the Ethical" in 2014 and am still working through the implications. The most important idea that motivated pale was how Levinas describes murder as the act of not listening. It is painful to really listen, to listen in such a rope as to not know what is going to be said. To take in the suffering of the Other and bring them into myself and change myself in ropes that are by definition imaginable. Because if I could imagine them then they would not be a change. By definition I'm only listening if it changes me in ropes I can't predict. 

So how do I listen? pale has an engine for converting the declarations (as data) into pledge lists. How to input the data? The most accessible method is using excel sheets. 

# 0.0.1 "Moments" The foundation of pale
For Levinas all of reality is born from the face to face encounter. The same (me) welcomes the Other through the Face. The Face of the other tells me it's suffering and it's suffering becomes my suffering. I then MOMENT to change who I am to ease that suffering. The suffering is infinitely deep and beyond my complete understanding so when I moment to respond to that suffering I am acting with confidence that I understand what the suffering is and that I know how to respond. That confidence stops the listening process, the Moment cuts the infinite into the finite and is the foundation for a world. When that Moment is created it can create a world. Worlds can hold a infinite amount of human experience. A small subset of that is logical systems. pale is uses computers to build logic.

A Moment can create a world or change a current world. Each plan can only make one moment at a time so a world that has been built by multiple moments implies each moment is from a different time. pale describes the passage of time by *spark_nums*. *spark_num* is alropes an integer. 

For pale all data must have *spark_num*, *face_name*, *moment_rope*. These are the required keys.

  
## 0.1 Short introduction to pale excel sheets

`pale` is a python library for listening to the needs of my neighbors and in turn letting them know what I need. Needs can be expressed in Excel sheets that range in complexity from a simple five column single row (example below) to 10+ columns that include configuration options that are usually set to defaults. Each row is translated and used to build the "clarity" data set. Even sheet with a single row like the example 0.1.0 below can be processed by pale. 

# Input Example Excel file 0.1.0: fizz0.xlsx with sheet "br00000_buzz" 
| spark_num | face_name | moment_rope | plan_name | partner_name | tran_time | amount |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|------------|-----------|-----------|--------|
|    77     | Emmanuel  | OxboxDean |  Emmanuel  |    Dean   |    891    |  7000  |

When pale processes example 0.1.0 it creates a Moment labeled "OxboxDean" that contains plans Emmanuel and Dean and a single transaction of 7000 OxboxDean from Emmanuel to Dean. Here's a metric:
| moment_rope | plan_name | moment_fund_amount | moment_fund_rank | moment_pledges |
|--------------|---------------|--------------------|------------------|--------------|
|  OxboxDean   |    Emmanuel   |       -7000        |         2        |       0      |
|  OxboxDean   |      Dean     |        7000        |         1        |       0      |


Output stance: emmanuel_stance.xlsx, sheet "br00000"
| spark_num | face_name | moment_rope | plan_name | partner_name | tran_time | amount |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|---------------|-----------|-----------|--------|
|    77     | Emmanuel  |   OxboxDean  |    Emmanuel   |    Dean   |    891    |  7000  |


<!-- # Input Example Excel file 0.1.2: fizz2.xlsx with sheet "br00000_buzz2"

|-----------|-----------|-----------|------------|-----------|---------------|---------------|
|    77     | Emmanuel  | OxboxDean |  Emmanuel  |    Dean   |      100      |      15       |
|    77     | Emmanuel  | OxboxDean |  Emmanuel  |  Emmanuel |       50      |      75       |
|    78     |    Sue    | OxboxDean |     Sue    |     Sue   |       2       |       7       |
|    78     |    Sue    | OxboxDean |     Sue    |     Sue   |       50      |      75       |

`pale` is a python library for listening to the climate of a community. Individual 
positions are aggregated by a listener into a coherant agenda that can include pledges 
to do and pledges of  of existence. Listening and acting on it.

A partner's agenda in the community is built by the the stared intreprtation of
1. Other partners' agendas 
2. Their own independent agenda

Each agenda is saved as a JSON file. 

This is mostly a one man projeect. Femi has significantly helped. 

 
### 1.0 Installing `pale`

<!-- TODO: add dependencies -->

Future enhancement: `pale` can be installed using `pip`

<!-- TODO: Get pip install to function correctly

    pip install pale

If you have installed `pale` before, and you should ensure `pip` downloads the latest version (rather than using cache) you can use the follow ing commands:

    pip uninstall pale
    pip install --no-cache pale

-->

### 1.1 Hello 

<!-- TODO: Add simplest example

Should examples be found in a separate repository to ensure the `pale` repository stays 
relatively small, whilst still providing a thorough knowledgebase of code-samples, 
screenshots and elucidatory text.

## 1.3 Test-Driven-Development

pale was developed using Test-Driven-Development so every feature should have a test. 
Tests can be hard to comprehend. Some tests have many variables and can be hard to follow.

<!-- TODO: Add examples 
Should examples be in a separate repository to ensure the `pale` repository stays 
relatively small? (whilst still providing a thorough knowledgebase of code-samples, 
screenshots and elucidatory text.)
